## Why RCNB?

### RCNB vs Base64

|           | Base64       | RCNB                                                          |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Speed     | ❌ Fast       | ✔️ Slow, motivate Intel to improve their CPU                   |
| Printable | ❌ On all OS  | ✔️ Only on newer OS, motivate users to upgrade their legacy OS |
| Niubility | ❌ Not at all | ✔️ RCNB!                                                     |
